# Blooded forums
This is the front end to the blooded forums, which is connecting to a python flask backend written by my friend. The main libraries I used were React, Redux and SASS. To see what other libraries I used, just check the package.json file at the root of the repo. This software currently supports signing up, logging in and out, creating a topic, creating posts, editing your post, performing privileged tasks such as locking a topic, changing your avatar or signature and probably some more I have forgotten. 

## Current TODOs
1. Change from using sanitized html to some sort of markdown language for the posts such as bbcode. This creates more flexibility.
2. Implement some of the blizzard api endpoints such as the guild progrress tracking.
3. Implement tests to cover as much relevant code as possible.
